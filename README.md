You are probably wanting the original version of [react-native-fast-tflite](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-fast-tflite) by Marc Rousavy.

This forked version uses the TFLite binary from the TensorFlowLiteSwift pod instead of builds from the (tensorflow)[https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow] repository.
